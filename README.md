This project implements a comprehensive data engineering solution that automates the transformation of raw Airbnb data into analytics-ready insights. Utilizing a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers), the pipeline handles the ingestion of listings, bookings, and host data. It leverages Incremental Loading to optimize performance and reduce cloud compute costs by processing only new or modified records.

The technical core of the project is built on Snowflake as the data warehouse and dbt (Data Build Tool) for the transformation layer. By leveraging advanced dbt features such as custom Jinja macros, snapshots for SCD Type 2 versioning, and automated data quality testing, the system ensures high-integrity data flow from AWS S3 to a final "One Big Table" (OBT) model. This architecture is designed for scalability, allowing for seamless integration with BI tools for downstream reporting.
